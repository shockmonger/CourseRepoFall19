    "Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function by training on a dataset, where is the number of dimensions for input and is the number of dimensions for output. Given a set of features and a target, it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression. It is different from logistic regression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers. Figure 1 shows a one hidden layer MLP with scalar output.\n",

    "Figure 1 : One hidden layer MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leftmost layer, known as the input layer, consists of a set of neurons\n",
    "representing the input features. Each neuron in the hidden layer transforms the values from the previous layer with a weighted linear summation , followed by a non-linear activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "- like the hyperbolic tan function. The output layer receives the values from the last hidden layer and transforms them into output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module contains the public attributes coefs_ and intercepts_. coefs_ is a list of weight matrices, where weight matrix at index\n",
