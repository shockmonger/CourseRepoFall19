This is the course repository for music and machine learning for MCT in the fall semester of 2019.

The course objectives are to be able to get a hands on feel for topics and applications in
the field of music and machine learning.

The previous readings and background works will ensure that you have python 3.7 running on
your system, with numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and pyTorch running on your system.

If you have not installed these dependencies yet, please install using the instructions in
the setup.py file.
